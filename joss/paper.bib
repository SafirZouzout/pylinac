   abstract = {Background: The multileaf collimator (MLC) is a critical component to accurate intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) delivery. This study examined MLC positional accuracy via MLC logs from Varian machines from six institutions and three delivery techniques to evaluate typical positional accuracy and treatment and mechanical parameters that affect accuracy. Typical accuracy achieved was compared against TG-142 recommendations for MLC performance; more appropriate recommendations are suggested.Methods: Over 85,000 Varian MLC treatment logs were collected from six institutions and analyzed with FractionCHECK. Data were binned according to institution and treatment type to determine overall root mean square (RMS) and 95th percentile error values, and then to look for correlations between those errors and with mechanical and treatment parameters including mean and maximum leaf speed, gantry angle, beam-on time, mean leaf error, and number of segments.Results: Results of treatment logs found that leaf RMS error and 95th percentile leaf error were consistent between institutions, but varied by treatment type. The step and shoot technique had very small errors: the mean RMS leaf error was 0.008 mm. For dynamic treatments the mean RMS leaf error was 0.32 mm, while volumetric-modulated arc treatment (VMAT) showed an RMS leaf error of 0.46 mm. Most MLC leaf errors were found to be well below TG-142 recommended tolerances. For the dynamic and VMAT techniques, the mean and maximum leaf speeds were significantly linked to the leaf RMS error. Additionally, for dynamic delivery, the mean leaf error was correlated with RMS error, whereas for VMAT the average gantry speed was correlated. For all treatments, the RMS error and the 95th percentile leaf error were correlated.Conclusions: Restricting the maximum leaf speed can help improve MLC performance for dynamic and VMAT deliveries. Furthermore, the tolerances of leaf RMS and error counts for all treatment types should be tightened from the TG-142 values to make them more appropriate for clinical performance. Values of 1 mm for the 95th percentile of leaf RMS error and 1.5 mm for the 95th percentile leaf error are suggested as action levels for all treatment types.},

   abstract = {In the present study, we describe a method based on the analysis of the dynamic MLC log files (DynaLog) generated by the controller of a Varian linear accelerator in order to perform patient-specific IMRT QA. The DynaLog files of a Varian Millennium MLC, recorded during an IMRT treatment, can be processed using a MATLAB-based code in order to generate the actual fluence for each beam and so recalculate the actual patient dose distribution using the Eclipse treatment planning system. The accuracy of the DynaLog-based dose reconstruction procedure was assessed by introducing ten intended errors to perturb the fluence of the beams of a reference plan such that ten subsequent erroneous plans were generated. In-phantom measurements with an ionization chamber (ion chamber) and planar dose measurements using an EPID system were performed to investigate the correlation between the measured dose changes and the expected ones detected by the reconstructed plans for the ten intended erroneous cases. Moreover, the method was applied to 20 cases of clinical plans for different locations (prostate, lung, breast, and head and neck). A dose-volume histogram (DVH) metric was used to evaluate the impact of the delivery errors in terms of dose to the patient. The ionometric measurements revealed a significant positive correlation (R2 = 0.9993) between the variations of the dose induced in the erroneous plans with respect to the reference plan and the corresponding changes indicated by the DynaLog-based reconstructed plans. The EPID measurements showed that the accuracy of the DynaLog-based method to reconstruct the beam fluence was comparable with the dosimetric resolution of the portal dosimetry used in this work (3%/3 mm). The DynaLog-based reconstruction method described in this study is a suitable tool to perform a patient-specific IMRT QA. This method allows us to perform patient-specific IMRT QA by evaluating the result based on the DVH metric of the planning CT image (patient DVH-based IMRT QA).},

   abstract = {Purpose: Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) includes features such as a variable dose rate and gantry speed in addition to the beam modulation achieved with multileaf collimator (MLC) motion patterns employed in intensity modulated radiotherapy. Three tests have previously been proposed for the evaluation of the performance of VMAT delivery. In order to enable a convenient and accurate routine machine quality control (QC) program, the present study proposes tolerance levels for these tests based on a department-wide implementation of an electronic portal imaging device (EPID)-based QC. Methods: Three different VMAT tests-a picket fence (PF) test, a dose rate versus gantry speed (DRGS) test, and a dose rate versus MLC leaf speed (DRMLC) test-were performed on nine accelerators using two different EPIDs (aS1000 and aS500, Varian Medical Systems). All tests were repeated six times for each accelerator. The images were analyzed using an in-house-developed software. For the PF test, the positions and widths of individual MLC leaf gaps were compared to the mean value. In the DRGS and DRMLC tests, different combinations of dose rate, gantry speed, and MLC leaf speed were used to deliver identical doses to separate parts of the EPID. The tests were evaluated by looking for deviations in the constancy of the measured dose for the preset combinations of dose rate, gantry speed, and MLC leaf speed. Results: For the PF test, a 0.3 mm tolerance level was suggested for the positioning of the MLC leaves. The tolerance level for the gap width was 0.5 mm. For the DRGS and DRMLC tests, a 3% tolerance level was proposed. Conclusions: With the adapted levels of tolerance for an EPID-based approach, the PF, the DRGS, and the DRMLC tests offer a convenient and accurate machine QC program for linear accelerators used for VMAT. © 2011 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

   abstract = {Purpose: The Varian RapidArc is a system for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatment planning and delivery. RapidArc incorporates capabilities such as variable dose-rate, variable gantry speed, and accurate and fast dynamic multileaf collimators (DMLC), to optimize dose conformality, delivery efficiency, accuracy and reliability. We developed RapidArc system commissioning and quality assurance (QA) procedures. Methods and Materials: Tests have been designed that evaluate RapidArc performance in a stepwise manner. First, the accuracy of DMLC position during gantry rotation is examined. Second, the ability to vary and control the dose-rate and gantry speed is evaluated. Third, the combined use of variable DMLC speed and dose-rate is studied. Results: Adapting the picket fence test for RapidArc, we compared the patterns obtained with stationary gantry and in RapidArc mode, and showed that the effect of gantry rotation on leaf accuracy was minimal (≤0.2 mm). We then combine different dose-rates (111-600 MU/min), gantry speeds (5.5-4.3°/s), and gantry range (Δθ = 90-12.9°) to give the same dose to seven parts of a film. When normalized to a corresponding open field (to account for flatness and asymmetry), the dose of the seven portions show good agreement, with a mean deviation of 0.7%. In assessing DMLC speed (0.46, 0.92, 1.84, and 2.76 cm/s) during RapidArc, the analysis of designed radiation pattern indicates good agreement, with a mean deviation of 0.4%. Conclusions: The results of these tests provide strong evidence that DMLC movement, variable dose-rates and gantry speeds can be precisely controlled during RapidArc. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was 2-fold. One purpose was to develop an automated, streamlined quality assurance (QA) program for use by multiple centers. The second purpose was to evaluate machine performance over time for multiple centers using linear accelerator (Linac) log files and electronic portal images. The authors sought to evaluate variations in Linac performance to establish as a reference for other centers. Methods: The authors developed analytical software tools for a QA program using both log files and electronic portal imaging device (EPID) measurements. The first tool is a general analysis tool which can read and visually represent data in the log file. This tool, which can be used to automatically analyze patient treatment or QA log files, examines the files for Linac deviations which exceed thresholds. The second set of tools consists of a test suite of QA fields, a standard phantom, and software to collect information from the log files on deviations from the expected values. The test suite was designed to focus on the mechanical tests of the Linac to include jaw, MLC, and collimator positions during static, IMRT, and volumetric modulated arc therapy delivery. A consortium of eight institutions delivered the test suite at monthly or weekly intervals on each Linac using a standard phantom. The behavior of various components was analyzed for eight TrueBeam Linacs. Results: For the EPID and trajectory log file analysis, all observed deviations which exceeded established thresholds for Linac behavior resulted in a beam hold off. In the absence of an interlocktriggering event, the maximum observed log file deviations between the expected and actual component positions (such as MLC leaves) varied from less than 1% to 26% of published tolerance thresholds. The maximum and standard deviations of the variations due to gantry sag, collimator angle, jaw position, and MLC positions are presented. Gantry sag among Linacs was 0.336±0.072 mm. The standard deviation in MLC position, as determined by EPID measurements, across the consortium was 0.33 mm for IMRT fields. With respect to the log files, the deviations between expected and actual positions for parameters were small (>0.12 mm) for all Linacs. Considering both log files and EPID measurements, all parameters were well within published tolerance values. Variations in collimator angle, MLC position, and gantry sag were also evaluated for all Linacs. Conclusions: The performance of the TrueBeam Linac model was shown to be consistent based on automated analysis of trajectory log files and EPID images acquired during delivery of a standardized test suite. The results can be compared directly to tolerance thresholds. In addition, sharing of results from standard tests across institutions can facilitate the identification of QA process and Linac changes. These reference values are presented along with the standard deviation for common tests so that the test suite can be used by other centers to evaluate their Linac performance against those in this consortium.},

   abstract = {As mechanical stability of radiation therapy treatment devices has gone beyond sub-millimeter levels, there is a rising demand for simple yet highly accurate measurement techniques to support the routine quality control of these devices. A combination of using high-resolution radiosensitive film and computer-aided analysis could provide an answer. One generally known technique is the acquisition of star shot films to determine the mechanical stability of rotations of gantries and the therapeutic beam. With computer-aided analysis, mechanical performance can be quantified as a radiation isocenter radius size. In this work, computer-aided analysis of star shot film is further refined by applying an analytical solution for the smallest intersecting circle problem, in contrast to the gradient optimization approaches used until today. An algorithm is presented and subjected to a performance test using two different types of radiosensitive film, the Kodak EDR2 radiographic film and the ISP EBT2 radiochromic film. Artificial star shots with a priori known radiation isocenter size are used to determine the systematic errors introduced by the digitization of the film and the computer analysis. The estimated uncertainty on the isocenter size measurement with the presented technique was 0.04 mm (2σ) and 0.06 mm (2σ) for radiographic and radiochromic films, respectively. As an application of the technique, a study was conducted to compare the mechanical stability of O-ring gantry systems with C-arm-based gantries. In total ten systems of five different institutions were included in this study and star shots were acquired for gantry, collimator, ring, couch rotations and gantry wobble. It was not possible to draw general conclusions about differences in mechanical performance between O-ring and C-arm gantry systems, mainly due to differences in the beamMLC alignment procedure accuracy. Nevertheless, the best performing O-ring system in this study, a BrainLab/MHI Vero system, and the best performing C-arm system, a Varian Truebeam system, showed comparable mechanical performance: gantry isocenter radius of 0.12 and 0.09mm, respectively, ring/couch rotation of below 0.10 mm for both systems and a wobble of 0.06 and 0.18 mm, respectively. The methodology described in this work can be used to monitor mechanical performance constancy of high-accuracy treatment devices, with means available in a clinical radiation therapy environment. © 2012 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

   abstract = {Uncertainty in localizing the radiation field center is among the major components that contribute to the overall positional error and thus must be minimized. In this study, we developed a Hough transform (HT)-based computer algorithm to localize the radiation center of a circular or rectangular field with subpixel accuracy. We found that the HT method detected the centers of the test circular fields with an absolute error of 0.037 0.019 pixels. On a typical electronic portal imager with 0.5 mm image resolution, this mean detection error was translated to 0.02 mm, which was much finer than the image resolution. It is worth noting that the subpixel accuracy described here does not include experimental uncertainties such as linac mechanical instability or room laser inaccuracy. The HT method was more accurate and more robust to image noise and artifacts than the traditional center-of-mass method. Application of the HT method in Winston-Lutz tests was demonstrated to measure the ball-radiation center alignment with subpixel accuracy. Finally, the method was applied to quantitative evaluation of the radiation center wobble during collimator rotation. © 2009 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

   abstract = {Purpose:Verification of the mechanical isocenter position is required as part of comprehensive quality assurance programs for stereotactic radiosurgery/radiotherapy (SRS/SRT) treatments. Several techniques have been proposed for this purpose but each of them has certain drawbacks. In this paper, a new efficient and more comprehensive method using cine-EPID images has been introduced for automatic verification of the isocenter with sufficient accuracy for stereotactic applications.Methods: Using a circular collimator fixed to the gantry head to define the field, EPID images of a Winston-Lutz phantom were acquired in cine-imaging mode during 360° gantry rotations. A robust matlab code was developed to analyze the data by finding the center of the field and the center of the ball bearing shadow in each image with sub-pixel accuracy. The distance between these two centers was determined for every image. The method was evaluated by comparison to results of a mechanical pointer and also by detection of a manual shift applied to the phantom position. The repeatability and reproducibility of the method were tested and it was also applied to detect couch and collimator wobble during rotation.Results:The accuracy of the algorithm was 0.03 ± 0.02 mm. The repeatability was less than 3 μm and the reproducibility was less than 86 μm. The time elapsed for the analysis of more than 100 cine images of Varian aS1000 and aS500 EPIDs were ∼65 and 20 s, respectively. Processing of images taken in integrated mode took 0.1 s. The output of the analysis software is printable and shows the isocenter shifts as a function of angle in both in-plane and cross-plane directions. It gives warning messages where the shifts exceed the criteria for SRS/SRT and provides useful data for the necessary adjustments in the system including bearing system and/or room lasers.Conclusions: The comprehensive method introduced in this study uses cine-images, is highly accurate, fast, and independent of the observer. It tests all gantry angles and is suitable for pretreatment QA of the isocenter for stereotactic treatments. © 2011 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

The authors have developed a method that uses these characteristics to carry out radiation field and light field coincidence quality assurance on linear accelerators. Methods: CR detectors from Kodak were used outside their cassettes to measure both radiation and light field edges from a Varian linear accelerator. The CR detector was first exposed to a radiation field and then to a slightly smaller light field. The light impinged on the detector's latent image, removing to an extent the portion exposed to the light field. The detector was then digitally scanned. A MATLAB-based algorithm was developed to automatically analyze the images and determine the edges of the light and radiation fields, the vector between the field centers, and the crosshair center. Radiographic film was also used as a control to confirm the radiation field size. Results: Analysis showed a high degree of repeatability with the proposed method. Results between the proposed method and radiographic film showed excellent agreement of the radiation field. The effect of varying monitor units and light exposure time was tested and found to be very small. Radiation and light field sizes were determined with an uncertainty of less than 1 mm, and light and crosshair centers were determined within 0.1 mm. Conclusions: A new method was developed to digitally determine the radiation and light field size using CR photo-stimulable phosphor plates.

In its clinical application and quality assurance (QA) approach, the CyberKnife is currently situated somewhere in between stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy.

A machine learning prediction model was developed to use linear accelerator parameters derived from the DICOM-RT plan to predict delivery discrepancies at treatment delivery (defined as the difference between trajectory log file and DICOM-RT) and was coupled with an independent Monte Carlo dose calculation algorithm for dosimetric analysis. Machine learning models for IMRT and VMAT were trained and validated using 120 IMRT and 206 VMAT fields of prior patients, with 80% assigned for iterative training and testing, and 20% for post-training validation. Various prediction models were trained and validated, with the final models selected for clinical implementation being a boosted tree and bagged tree for IMRT and VMAT, respectively. After validation, these models were then applied clinically to predict the machine parameters at treatment delivery for 7 IMRT plans from various sites (61 fields) and 10 VMAT multi-target intracranial radiosurgery plans (35 arcs) and compared to the dosimetric effect calculated directly from trajectory log files. Dose indices tracked for targets and organs at risk included dose received by 99%, 95%, and 1% of the volume, mean dose, percent of volume receiving 25%–100% of the prescription dose. The average coefficient of determination (r2) when comparing intra-field predicted and actual delivery error was 0.987 ± 0.012 for IMRT and 0.895 ± 0.095 for VMAT, whereas r2 when comparing inter-field predicted versus actual delivery error was 0.982 for IMRT and 0.989 for VMAT. Regarding dosimetric analysis, r2 when comparing predicted versus actual dosimetric changes for all dose indices was 0.966 for IMRT and 0.907 for VMAT. Prediction models can be used to anticipate the dosimetric effect calculated from trajectory files and have potential as a “delivery-free” pretreatment analysis to enhance PSQA.},

Uniformity was best for Siemens Edge, whereas most scans for ClearRT exhibited a slight “cupping” or “capping” artifact. The ClearRT and Siemens Edge performed best for contrast metrics, which included low-contrast visibility and contrast-to-noise ratio evaluations. Spatial resolution was best for TrueBeam and Siemens Edge, whereas the three kVCT systems exhibited similar CT number linearity. Overall, these results provide an initial indication that ClearRT image quality is adequate for image guidance in radiotherapy and sufficient for delineating anatomic structures, thus enabling its use for ART. ClearRT also showed significant improvement over MVCT, which was previously the only onboard imaging modality available on Radixact. Although the acquisition of these scans does come at the cost of additional patient dose, reported CTDI values indicate a similar or generally reduced machine output for ClearRT compared to the other systems while maintaining comparable or improved image quality overall.},

   abstract = {A hybrid quality control (QC) program was developed that integrates automated and conventional Linac QC, realizing the benefits of both automated and conventional QC, increasing efficiency and maintaining independent measurement methods. Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) was then applied in order to validate the program prior to clinical implementation. The hybrid QC program consists of automated QC with machine performance check and DailyQA3 array on the TrueBeam Linac, and Delta4 volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) standard plan measurements, alongside conventional monthly QC at a reduced frequency. The FMEA followed the method outlined in TG-100. Process maps were created for each treatment type at our center: VMAT, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), conformal, and palliative. Possible failure modes were established by evaluating each stage in the process map. The FMEA followed semiquantitative methods, using data from our QC records from eight Linacs over 3 years for the occurrence estimates, and simulation of failure modes in the treatment planning system, with scoring surveys for severity and detectability. The risk priority number (RPN) was calculated from the product of the occurrence, severity, and detectability scores and then normalized to the maximum and ranked to determine the most critical failure modes. The highest normalized RPN values (100, 90) were found to be for MLC position dynamic for both VMAT and SBRT treatments. The next highest score was 35 for beam position for SBRT, and the majority of scores were less than 20. Overall, these RPN scores for the hybrid Linac QC program indicated that it would be acceptable, but the high RPN score associated with the dynamic MLC failure mode indicates that it would be valuable to perform more rigorous testing of the MLC. The FMEA proved to be a useful tool in validating hybrid QC.},

   abstract = {In modern radiotherapy (RT), especially for stereotactic radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery treatments, image guidance is essential. Recently, the ExacTrac Dynamic (EXTD) system, a new combined surface-guided RT and image-guided RT (IGRT) system for patient positioning, monitoring, and tumor targeting, was introduced in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to provide more information about the geometric accuracy of EXTD and its workflow in a clinical environment. The surface optical/thermal- and the stereoscopic X-ray imaging positioning systems of EXTD was evaluated and compared to cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Additionally, the congruence with the radiation isocenter was tested. A Winston Lutz test was executed several times over 1 year, and repeated end-to-end positioning tests were performed. The magnitude of the displacements between all systems, CBCT, stereoscopic X-ray, optical-surface imaging, and MV portal imaging was within the submillimeter range, suggesting that the image guidance provided by EXTD is accurate at any couch angle. Additionally, results from the evaluation of 14 patients with intracranial tumors treated with open-face masks are reported, and limited differences with a maximum of 0.02 mm between optical/thermal- and stereoscopic X-ray imaging were found. As the optical/thermal positioning system showed a comparable accuracy to other IGRT systems, and due to its constant monitoring capability, it can be an efficient tool for detecting intra-fractional motion and for real-time tracking of the surface position during RT.},

   abstract = {Background and Purpose: Motor failure in multi-leaf collimators (MLC) is a common reason for unscheduled accelerator maintenance, disrupting the workflow of a radiotherapy treatment centre. Predicting MLC replacement needs ahead of time would allow for proactive maintenance scheduling, reducing the impact MLC replacement has on treatment workflow. We propose a multivariate approach to analysis of trajectory log data, which can be used to predict upcoming MLC replacement needs. Materials and methods: Trajectory log files from two accelerators, spanning six and seven months respectively, have been collected and analysed. The average error in each of the parameters for each log file was calculated and used for further analysis. A performance index (PI) was generated by applying moving window principal component analysis to the prepared data. Drops in the PI were thought to indicate an upcoming MLC replacement requirement; therefore, PI was tracked with exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts complete with a lower control limit. Results: The best compromise of fault detection and minimising false alarm rate was achieved using a weighting parameter (λ) of 0.05 and a control limit based on three standard deviations and an 80 data point window. The approach identified eight out of thirteen logged MLC replacements, one to three working days in advance whilst, on average, raising a false alarm, on average, 1.1 times a month. Conclusions: This approach to analysing trajectory log data has been shown to enable prediction of certain upcoming MLC failures, albeit at a cost of false alarms.},

   abstract = {Purpose: In this study, we evaluate and compare single isocenter multiple target VMAT (SIMT) and Conformal Arc Informed VMAT (CAVMAT) radiosurgery's sensitivity to uncertainties in dosimetric leaf gap (DLG) and treatment delivery. CAVMAT is a novel planning technique that uses multiple target conformal arcs as the starting point for limited inverse VMAT optimization. Methods: All VMAT and CAVMAT plans were recalculated with DLG values of 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 mm. DLG effect on V6Gy[cc], V12Gy[cc], and V16Gy[cc], and target dose was evaluated. Plans were delivered to a Delta4 (ScandiDos, Madison, WI) phantom and gamma analysis performed with varying criteria. Log file analysis was performed to evaluate MLC positional error. Sixteen targets were delivered to a SRS MapCHECK (Sun Nuclear Corp., Melbourne, FL) to evaluate VMAT and CAVMAT's dose difference (DD) as a function of DLG. Results: VMAT's average maximum and minimum target dose sensitivity to DLG was 9.08 ±3.50%/mm and 9.50 ± 3.30%/mm, compared to 3.20 ± 1.60%/mm and 4.72 ± 1.60%/mm for CAVMAT. For VMAT, V6Gy[cc], V12Gy[cc], and V16Gy[cc] sensitivity was 35.83 ± 9.50%/mm, 34.12 ± 6.60%/mm, and 39.23 ± 8.40%/mm. In comparison, CAVMAT's sensitivity was 23.19 ± 4.50%/mm, 22.45 ± 4.40%/mm, and 24.88 ± 4.90%/mm, respectively. Upon delivery to the Delta4, CAVMAT offered superior dose agreement compared to VMAT. For a 1%/1 mm gamma analysis, VMAT and CAVMAT had a passing rate of 94.53 ± 4.40% and 99.28 ± 1.70%, respectively. CAVMAT was more robust to DLG variation, with the SRS MapCHECK plans yielding an absolute average DD sensitivity of 2.99 ± 1.30%/mm compared to 5.07 ± 1.10%/mm for VMAT. Log files demonstrated minimal differences in MLC positional error for both techniques. Conclusions: CAVMAT remains robust to delivery uncertainties while offering a target dose sensitivity to DLG less than half that of VMAT, and 65% of that of VMAT for V6Gy[cc], V12Gy[cc], and V16Gy[cc]. The superior dose agreement and reduced sensitivity of CAVMAT to DLG uncertainties indicate promise as a robust alternative to VMAT for SIMT SRS.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To compare the sensitivity of ArcCHECK (AC), portal dosimetry (PD), and an in-house logfile-based system (LF) to multileaf collimators (MLC) aperture errors and the ability to identify these errors. Methods and Materials: For 12 retrospective original head and neck volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans, MLC aperture errors of ± 0.4mm, ± 1.2mm, ± 2mm, and ± 3mm were introduced for each plan, resulting in 96 plans with errors. AC, PD, and LF were used for the gamma evaluation at 3%/3mm, 3%/2mm, and 2%/2mm criteria. Gradient analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity to MLC aperture errors. The area under the curve (AUC) obtained from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the ability to identify MLC aperture errors and dose errors, and the optimal cut-off value to identify the error was obtained. Results: The gamma pass rate (%GP) of LF had the smallest descent gradient as the MLC error increases in any case. The descent gradient of PD was larger than AC, except for the case at the 2%/2mm criteria. For the 3%/3mm criteria, the MLC aperture errors that can be perfectly identified by AC, PD, and LF were ± 3mm, ± 2mm, and ± 1.2mm, respectively, and the average percent dose error (%DEs) of dose metrics in targets that can be perfectly identified were 4% to 5%, 3% to 4%, and 2% to 3%, respectively. For the 3%/2mm criteria, the errors that AC, PD, and LF can perfectly identify were the same as the 3%/3mm criteria. For the 2%/2mm criteria, AC can perfectly identify the MLC error of ± 2mm and the %DE of 3% to 4%. PD and LF can identify the MLC error of ± 1.2mm and the %DE of 2% to 3%. Conclusion: Different patient-specific quality assurance (PSQA) systems have different sensitivity and recognition abilities to MLC aperture errors. Institutions should formulate their own customized %GP limits based on their PSQA process through ROC or other methods.},

Materials and methods: A total of 118 clinical VMAT plans, including 28 mediastina, 25 head and neck, 40 brains intensity-modulated radiosurgery, and 25 prostate cases, were created in RayStation treatment planning system for Edge and TrueBeam linacs. In-house scripts were developed to compute Modulation indices such as plan-averaged beam area (PA), plan-averaged beam irregularity (PI), total monitor unit (MU), leaf travel/arc length, mean dose rate variation, and mean gantry speed variation. Pretreatment verifications were performed on ArcCHECK phantom with SNC software. GPR was calculated with 3%/2 mm and 10% threshold. The dataset was randomly split into a training (70%) and a test (30%) dataset. A random forest regression (RFR) model and support vector regression (SVR) with linear kernel were trained to predict GPR using the complexity metrics as input. The prediction performance was evaluated by calculating the mean absolute error (MAE), R2, and root mean square error (RMSE). Results: RMSEs at γ 3%/2 mm for RFR and SVR were 1.407 ± 0.103 and 1.447 ± 0.121, respectively. MAE was 1.14 ± 0.084 for RFR and 1.101 ± 0.09 for SVR. R2 was equal to 0.703 ± 0.027 and 0.689 ± 0.053 for RFR and SVR, respectively. GPR of 3%/2 mm with a 10% threshold can be predicted with an error smaller than 3% for 94% of plans using RFR and SVR models. The most important metrics that had the greatest impact on how accurately GPR can be predicted were determined to be the PA, PI, and total MU. Conclusion: In terms of its prediction values and errors, SVR (linear) appeared to be comparable with RFR for this dataset. Based on our results, the PA, PI, and total MU calculations may be useful in guiding VMAT plan evaluation and ultimately reducing uncertainties in planning and radiation delivery.},

To provide a clinical tool to perform patient specific QA accurately, the UNet++ is investigated to classify failed or pass fields (the GPR lower than 85% is considered “failed” while the GPR higher than 85% is considered “pass”), predict gamma passing rates (GPR) for different gamma criteria, and predict dose difference from virtual patient-specific quality assurance in radiotherapy. UNet++ was trained and validated with 473 fields and tested with 95 fields. All plans used Portal Dosimetry for dose verification pre-treatment. Planar dose distribution of each field was used as the input for UNet++, with QA classification results, gamma passing rates of different gamma criteria, and dose difference were used as the output. In the test set, the accuracy of the classification model was 95.79%. The mean absolute error (MAE) were 0.82, 0.88, 2.11, 2.52, and the root mean squared error (RMSE) were 1.38, 1.57, 3.33, 3.72 for 3%/3mm, 3%/2 mm, 2%/3 mm, 2%/2 mm, respectively. The trend and position of the predicted dose difference were consistent with the measured dose difference. In conclusion, the Virtual QA based on UNet++ can be used to classify the field passed or not, predict gamma pass rate for different gamma criteria, and predict dose difference. The results show that UNet++ based Virtual QA is promising in quality assurance for radiotherapy.},

   abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study is to compare the dosimetric and mechanical accuracy of Volumetric Modulation Arc Therapy (VMAT) delivery on the Halcyon, a recent ring-shaped Treatment Delivery System (TDS) featuring fast rotating gantry, with a conventional C-arm Linac. Methods: The comparison was performed via log file analysis, where mechanical parameters of related components was extracted. 480 and 3951 VMAT log files of clinically delivered fractions from a Halcyon and a TrueBeam Linac were analyzed respectively. The relations between mechanical parameters and errors were extensively explored to further investigate the differences between the two Linacs. The mechanical parameter fluctuations were taken into account for dose recalculations, and the Dose Volume Parameters (DVP) on the PTV were evaluated to quantify such dosimetric variations. Results: The Multi-Leaf Collimator (MLC) leaf mean Root Mean Square (RMS) errors were 0.028 mm and 0.031 mm for Halcyon and TrueBeam respectively. Maximum systematic error on the MLC leaves introduced by the gravity effect were 0.04 mm and 0.01 mm for the Halcyon and TrueBeam respectively. Thanks to the O-ring design, the Halcyon achieved 0.035° in mean RMS error in gantry angle compared with the 0.065° of the TrueBeam. Overall mechanical errors introduced similar levels of dose-volume parameter variations (about 0.1%) on both Linacs. Conclusion: The Halcyon TDS can achieve similar mechanical leaf positioning accuracy compared with the TrueBeam TDS with a doubled delivery speed. In terms of dosimetric accuracy, The DVP standard deviations on the studied TB are generally larger than that on the Halcyon.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Multileaf collimator (MLC) delivery discrepancy between planned and actual (delivered) positions have detrimental effect on the accuracy of dose distributions for both IMRT and VMAT. In this study, we evaluated the consistency of MLC delivery discrepancies over the course of treatment and over time to verify that a predictive machine learning model would be applicable throughout the course of treatment. Next, the MLC and gantry positions recorded in prior trajectory log files were analyzed to build a machine learning algorithm to predict MLC positional discrepancies during delivery for a new treatment plan. An open source tool was developed and released to predict the MLC positional discrepancies at treatment delivery for any given plan. Methods: Trajectory log files of 142 IMRT plans and 125 VMAT plans from 9 Varian TrueBeam linear accelerators were collected and analyzed. The consistency of delivery discrepancy over patient-specific quality assurance (QA) and patient treatment deliveries was evaluated. Data were binned by treatment site and machine type to determine their relationship with MLC and gantry angle discrepancies. Motion-related parameters including MLC velocity, MLC acceleration, control point, dose rate, and gravity vector, gantry velocity and gantry acceleration, where applicable, were analyzed to evaluate correlations with MLC and gantry discrepancies. Several regression models, such as simple/multiple linear regression, decision tree, and ensemble method (boosted tree and bagged tree model) were used to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict MLC discrepancy based on MLC motion parameters. Results: MLC discrepancies at patient-specific QA differed from those at patient treatment deliveries by a small (mean = 0.0021 ± 0.0036 mm, P = 0.0089 for IMRT; mean = 0.0010 ± 0.0016 mm, P = 0.0003 for VMAT) but statistically significant amount, likely due to setting the gantry angle to zero for QA in IMRT. MLC motion parameters, MLC velocity and gravity vector, showed significant correlation (P < 0.001) with MLC discrepancy, especially MLC velocity, which had an approximately linear relationship (slope = −0.0027, P < 0.001, R2 = 0.79). Incorporating MLC motion parameters, the final generalized model trained by data from all linear accelerators can predict MLC discrepancy to a high degree of accuracy with high correlation (R2 = 0.86) between predicted and actual MLC discrepancies. The same prediction results were found across different treatment sites and linear accelerators. Conclusion: We have developed a machine learning model using trajectory log files to predict the MLC discrepancies during delivery. This model has been a released as a research tool in which a DICOM-RT with predicted MLC positions can be generated using the original DICOM-RT file as input. This tool can be used to simulate radiotherapy treatment delivery and may be useful for studies evaluating plan robustness and dosimetric uncertainties from treatment delivery.},

This quality assurance test extends the traditional Winston-Lutz test, which considers a single target located at isocentre. Approach. Plans for a 3D-printed phantom are provided, which can be customized to accommodate various target (BB) positions. Given BB positions and gantry/collimator/couch combinations, the software generates multi-leaf collimator positions to facilitate multi-target Winston-Lutz (MTWL) plan creation. The software determines deviations between detected and expected BB positions on MV images resulting from MTWL plan delivery. BBs are located using a Hough circle detection algorithm, which is modified to favour the detection of circles: (1) having a reasonable size, (2) that are contained within the radiation field, and (3) having reasonable pixel intensities. Validation was performed in two ways: (1) using synthetic data with zero targeting errors and (2) by measuring real linac targeting errors and comparing against results obtained using a commercial system. Main results. Validation using the synthetic data yielded a mean (maximum) absolute discrepancy of 0.11 mm (0.21 mm), which is comparable to the synthetic phantom resolution (0.2 mm). The mean (maximum) absolute discrepancy compared to the commercial system is 0.13 mm (0.43 mm). These values are similar to results obtained with repeated deliveries of the same MTWL plan with the same phantom setup. Both validation tests yield reasonable results and are therefore considered successful. The MTWL test was performed independently by three physicists on two linacs to investigate repeatability, resulting in a mean (maximum) absolute discrepancy of 0.14 mm (0.51 mm) among the various attempts. Significance. Successful completion of this quality assurance test, using our customizable and open-source system, provides confidence that multi-target, single isocentre radiotherapy treatments can be delivered with sufficient geometric accuracy according to the chosen tolerance level.},

   abstract = {Purpose: This study demonstrates a robust Cherenkov imaging-based solution to MR-Linac daily QA, including mechanical-imaging-radiation isocenter coincidence verification. Methods: A fully enclosed acrylic cylindrical phantom was designed to be mountable to the existing jig, indexable to the treatment couch. An ABS plastic conical structure was fixed inside the phantom, held in place with 3D-printed spacers, and filled with water allowing for high edge contrast on MR imaging scans. Both a star shot plan and a four-angle sheet beam plan were delivered to the phantom; the former allowed for radiation isocenter localization in the x–z plane (A/P and L/R directions) relative to physical landmarks on the phantom, and the latter allowed for the longitudinal position of the sheet beam to be encoded as a ring of Cherenkov radiation emitted from the phantom, allowing for isocenter localization on the y-axis (S/I directions). A custom software application was developed to perform near-real-time analysis of the data by any clinical user. Results: Calibration procedures show that linearity between longitudinal position and optical ring diameter is high (R2 > 0.99), and that RMSE is low (0.184 mm). The star shot analysis showed a minimum circle radius of 0.34 mm. The final isocenter coincidence measurements in the lateral, longitudinal, and vertical directions were −0.61 mm, 0.55 mm, and −0.14 mm, respectively, and the total 3D distance coincidence was 0.83 mm, with each of these being below 2 mm tolerance. Conclusion: This novel system provided an efficient, MR safe, all-in-one method for acquisition and near-real-time analysis of isocenter coincidence data. This represents a direct measurement of the 3D isocentricity. The combination of this phantom and the custom analysis application makes this solution readily clinically deployable after the longitudinal analysis of performance consistency.},

Nominal CBCT projections with reduced exposure times were reconstructed in 3D using the Unfiltered and Filtered-back Projection algorithms. Patient organ dose (mGy) per procedure for brain, chest, pelvis, abdomen, and head and neck were 7.9, 35.3, 28.1, 58.3, and 0.77, respectively. The experimental analysis suggests that adequate image quality could be obtained while decreasing the number of radiographic projections. Reducing the number of the radiographic projections will reduce the scan time and therefore the imaging dose. The proposed method provides an opportunity to reduce the organ doses comparatively lower than the standard CT doses for head and body protocols. The study provides a framework for delivering low radiation doses to critical organs with no risk of long-term exposure.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To develop and demonstrate a comprehensive method to directly measure radiation isocenter uncertainty and coincidence with the cone-beam computed tomography (kV-CBCT) imaging coordinate system that can be carried out within a typical quality assurance (QA) time slot. Methods: An N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) three-dimensional (3D) dosimeter for which dose is observed as increased electron density in kV-CBCT is irradiated at eight couch/gantry combinations which enter the dosimeter at unique orientations. One to three CBCTs are immediately acquired, radiation profile is detected per beam, and displacement from imaging isocenter is quantified. We performed this test using a 5 mm diameter MLC field, and 7.5 and 4 mm diameter cones, delivering approximately 16 Gy per beam. CBCT settings were 1035–4050 mAs, 80–125 kVs, smooth filter, 1 mm slice thickness. The two-dimensional (2D) displacement of each beam from the imaging isocenter was measured within the planning system, and Matlab code developed in house was used to quantify relevant parameters based on the actual beam geometry. Detectability of the dose profile in the CBCT was quantified as the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the irradiated high-dose regions relative to the surrounding background signal. Our results were compared to results determined by the traditional Winston-Lutz test, film-based “star shots,” and the vendor provided machine performance check (MPC). The ability to detect alignment errors was demonstrated by repeating the test after applying a 0.5 mm shift to the MLCs in the direction of leaf travel. In addition to radiation isocenter and coincidence with CBCT origin, the analysis also calculated the actual gantry and couch angles per beam. Results: Setup, MV irradiation, and CBCT readout were carried out within 38 min. After subtracting the background signal from the pre-CBCT, the CNR of the dosimeter signal from the irradiation with the MLCs (125 kVp, 1035 mAs, n = 3), 7.5 mm cone (125 kVp, 1035 mAs, n = 3), and 4 mm cone (80 kVp, 4050 mAs, n = 1) was 5.4, 5.9, and 2.9, respectively. The minimum radius that encompassed all beams calculated using the automated analysis was 0.38, 0.48, and 0.44 mm for the MLCs, 7.5 mm cone, and 4 mm cone, respectively. When determined manually, these values were slightly decreased at 0.28, 0.41, and 0.40 mm. For comparison, traditional Winston-Lutz test with MLCs and MPC measured the 3D isocenter radius to be 0.24 mm. Lastly, when a 0.5 mm shift to the MLCs was applied, the smallest radius that intersected all beams increased from 0.38 to 0.90 mm. The mean difference from expected value for gantry angle was 0.19 ± 0.29°, 0.17 ± 0.23°, and 0.12 ± 0.14° for the MLCs, 7.5 mm cone, and 4 mm cone, respectively. The mean difference from expected for couch angle was −0.07 ± 0.28°, −0.08 ± 0.66°, and 0.04 ± 0.25°. Conclusions: This work demonstrated the feasibility of a comprehensive isocenter verification using a NIPAM dosimeter with sub-mm accuracy which incorporates evaluation of coincidence with imaging coordinate system, and may be applicable to all SRS cones as well as MLCs.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Varian provides a DICOM RT Plan file that users can deliver to the electronic portal imaging device (EPID) panel to confirm the linear accelerator delivers consistent dose output across several regions of interest for varying dose rates and gantry speeds (DRGS). This work investigates if (a) the vendor-provided DRGS DICOM RT Plan is valid within the gantry speed range of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatments, and (b) if output constancy is maintained at those gantry speeds on a TrueBeam. Methods: Python code was written to iterate through all control points in the DICOM RT Plan files for 21 SBRT patients and the MU per degree values were calculated for each control point. A histogram was generated to illustrate how MU per degree was distributed among the control points from the patient plans. Then, the total number of MUs was increased in the vendor-provided DRGS DICOM file to make a “modified DRGS DICOM RT Plan,” which surpasses the maximum MU per degree value found in the patient plans, forcing the gantry to travel at slow speeds and deliver more MU per degree over the same arc length (representative of those during SBRT treatment delivery). The modified DRGS DICOM RT Plan file was then delivered on a TrueBeam to acquire EPID images of the dose distribution. The EPID images were analyzed with Pylinac, a Python library that analyzes DICOM RT images acquired during routine linac QA. Results: Over 83% of patient DICOM RT Plan control points had MU per degree values greater than the MU per degree values in the vendor-provided DRGS DICOM file. The Pylinac analysis of the EPID-acquired images found a maximum deviation of 0.4% from machine baselines. Conclusions: The modified DRGS DICOM file can be used to determine if a TrueBeam linac is operating within specifications even when very low gantry speeds are reached.},

   abstract = {Intensity modulation treatments are widely used in radiotherapy because of many known advantages. In this context, the picket fence test (PF) is a relevant test to check the Multileaf Collimator (MLC) performances. So this work compares and evaluates three analysis platforms for the PF used routinely by three different institutions. This study covers two linear accelerators (Linac) with two MLC types, a Millenium 120 MLC and Millenium 120 High Definition MLC respectively on a Varian Truebeam and Truebeam STx. Both linacs include an As 1200 portal imager (EPID). From a reference PF plan, MLC errors have been introduced to modify the slits in position or width (shifts from 0.1 to 0.5 mm on one or both banks). Then errors have been defined on the EPID to investigate detection system deviations (signal sensitivity and position variations). Finally, 110 DICOM-RT images have been generated and analyzed by each software system. All software systems have shown good performances to quantify the position errors, even though the leaf pair identifications can be wrong in some cases regarding the analysis method considered. The slit width measurement (not calculated by all software systems) has shown good sensitivity, but some quantification difficulties have been highlighted regardless of the analysis method used. Linked to the expected accuracy of the PF test, the imager variations have demonstrated considerable influence in the results. Differences in the results and the analysis methods have been pointed out for each software system. The results can be helpful to optimize the settings of each analysis software system depending on expectations and treatment modalities of each institution.},

   abstract = {In this survey, we investigate the usage of Trajectory log data in a single case of a patient undergoing Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) treatment. A dedicated linear accelerator machine Varian TrueBeam STX was used. The software was developed for analyzing the log files which were created by the machine when a certain plan was performed in treatment mode or QA mode. Four plans were created with 7 no-coplanar fields. Additional structures must be added by the physicist in the contouring section in order to optimize the plans. Dosimetry equipment ArcCHECK was used to verify the dose distribution for the created plan. The evaluation of γpassing rate (%GP) from the Trajectory log was done for each field separately using Pylinac v.2.2.6 API (application programing interface) for Machine quality control. It was shown that for one of the plans the values of %GP in some of the fields were very low with about less than 15% passing and at the same time the ArcCHECK shows a good %GP of about 90%. When verifying the plans using the analyzed Trajectory log files it can be detected if there are problems with the rotation of the collimator, the positioning of the collimator jaws or with over-modulating of the plan.},
